- **PROFESSIONAL UX**: No amateur interactions, loading states, or error handling

## Phase 7: Conversations Page ‚Äî SOTA Chat Interface ‚úÖ MAJOR PROGRESS

**üéâ RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS (Aug 23, 2025):**
- ‚úÖ **Beautiful Message Styling**: Implemented production-ready glass message bubbles
- ‚úÖ **Perfect Contrast Balance**: Royal blue user messages + gray glass AI messages

- User messages: Beautiful royal blue gradient (unchanged, as requested)
- AI messages: Gray glass with enhanced blur and professional shadows
- Hover effects: Subtle royal blue accents on interaction
- Visual hierarchy: Balanced contrast without jarring differences

**USER FEEDBACK**: ‚úÖ "Really like the cards till now" - Ready for production!

Principles ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- Keep existing user message styling exactly as-is; linear thread.
- Black-first palette with Royal Ink Glass accents; no translate/motion animations.
- One scrollable area for messages; input fixed at bottom; clutter-free layout.
- LLM output renders as Markdown (GFM) with safe HTML; code blocks styled and copyable.
- Small, verified increments: implement ‚Üí you verify ‚Üí update status ‚Üí proceed.

Locked UX decisions (confirmed)
- Timestamps: hidden by default, shown on hover.
- Group consecutive messages by author with subtle radius changes.
- Max chat width: 800px centered column.
- Jump-to-latest chip: appears when >200px from bottom; smooth scroll on click.
- Typing indicator: simple inline text (no animations).
- Empty state: 2x2 suggestion grid on desktop (1x2 mobile) + ‚ÄúWrite Custom Blog‚Äù; disappears after first message.
- Scrollbar: minimal thin style, slightly wider on hover.
- Code blocks: preserve whitespace + copy button.
- Export scope: conversation-level and per-message (copy MD/text, print-to-PDF, download .md).
- Virtualization: add react-virtuoso after baseline is stable.
- Streaming transport: auto-detect; SSE confirmed.

Backend alignment (verified)
- Endpoints in `backend/app/api/v1/conversations.py`:
	- GET `/api/v1/conversations/{id}` ‚Üí returns { conversationId, title, createdAt, forkedFrom, messages[] } with message { messageId, role, content, isBlog, createdAt }.
	- POST `/api/v1/conversations/{id}/messages` ‚Üí create user message (UI already sends).
	- GET `/api/v1/conversations/{id}/stream?message_id=...` (SSE) ‚Üí events: `ai_response`, `ai_complete` (UI already uses EventSource).
	- POST `/api/v1/conversations/{id}/generate-blog` (SSE) ‚Üí events: `blog_response`, `blog_complete`.
	- DELETE `/api/v1/conversations/{id}` ‚Üí archive conversation (frontend treats as delete; matches list page behavior).
- Blog publish path available via posts service (`publishBlogAsPost`).
- No rename/share endpoints detected (deferred).

Milestone A: Structure & Layout (no new deps)
- [ ] Single scroll container; remove nested scrollbars; input sticky at bottom with safe-area.
- [ ] ConversationHeader: title + available metadata only; ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù uses archive API.
- [ ] Empty state (0 messages only): suggestion grid + ‚ÄúWrite Custom Blog‚Äù; hide immediately after first message.
- [ ] Smart autoscroll + floating ‚ÄúJump to latest‚Äù chip (>200px from bottom).
- [ ] A11y: role="log", aria-live="polite", predictable tab order.
Acceptance: 1 scrollbar, clean single-column (when not showing blog), input pinned, jump chip works, zero-state rule enforced, no transforms.

Milestone B: Streaming & Input
- [ ] Sentence-by-sentence streaming using existing SSE; inline ‚ÄúAssistant is typing‚Ä¶‚Äù text.
- [ ] Input: auto-resize; Enter=send, Shift+Enter=newline; optimistic user bubble; robust error with toast + optional retry in-bubble.
Acceptance: smooth stream, reliable send/retry, no scroll fights, no layout shifts.

Milestone C: Markdown Rendering & Copy
- [ ] React Markdown pipeline: remark-gfm + rehype-sanitize; Prism highlighting; GitHub Dark Dimmed theme.
- [ ] Preserve whitespace; safe links; accessible code blocks with ‚ÄúCopy‚Äù button.
- [ ] Per-message actions (hover 3-dots): Copy Markdown, Copy Plain Text.
Acceptance: faithful MD rendering, copy tools work, timestamps on hover, grouped bubbles stable.

Milestone D: Export & Share (simple, useful)
- [ ] Conversation-level: Copy all as Markdown; Download .md.
- [ ] Print-to-PDF: print-friendly route; ‚ÄúExport PDF‚Äù opens native print dialog (no heavy deps).
- [ ] Per-message print view if low risk; otherwise follow-up.
Acceptance: clean PDF export with theme + code styles; .md export correct.

Milestone E: Performance (long histories)
- [ ] Add react-virtuoso virtualization; memoized items; lazy images.
- [ ] Progressive pagination when backend adds cursors (deferred if unsupported).
Acceptance: smooth with large histories; stable autoscroll/jump behavior.

Notes
- ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù in UI maps to backend archive; keep behavior consistent with conversations list.
- Zero-state ‚ÄúWrite Custom Blog‚Äù only when there are 0 messages (already partially implemented); must disappear on first send.
- No translate/movement animations anywhere; rely on opacity/blur-only per theme.

Next step after approval
- Implement Milestone A in a small PR-sized change, request your verification, then update this doc and proceed to Milestone B.
