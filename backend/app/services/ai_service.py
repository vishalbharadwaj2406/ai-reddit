"""
AI Service for AI Social Platform

This service handles AI interactions including:
- Generating AI responses to user messages
- Streaming responses token by token
- Managing AI conversation context
- Error handling for AI service failures

For MVP, this will use Google Gemini API via LangChain.
Future versions may support multiple AI providers.
