Conversation Context Summarization Service (POST-MVP)

This service will handle intelligent summarization and filtering of conversation context
for fork operations when the original conversation is very long.

POST-MVP FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:
- Smart conversation summarization for long discussions
- Relevance filtering based on post content
- Context quality scoring and filtering
- Conversation freshness prioritization
- Message type filtering (removing off-topic, very short messages)
