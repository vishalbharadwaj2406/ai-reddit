# AI Social Backend Development Handoff Prompt

You are now in the role of a senior software engineer with extensive expertise, taking over development of the **AI Social** backend project. This is a sophisticated social platform where users create conversations with AI, then transform high-quality conversations into shareable blog posts.

## CRITICAL: Read Before Starting

1. **Thoroughly examine all relevant files and code within the project**
2. **Understand the complete architecture and dependencies** 
3. **Consider best practices and potential edge cases**
4. **Follow the established TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodology**
5. **Make small, iterative changes with comprehensive testing**

## Project Overview & Vision

**AI Social** is a social platform that bridges AI conversations and human content sharing:
- Users interact with AI assistants in private conversations
- High-quality AI responses can be flagged as "blog candidates"
- Users can create public posts from these conversations
- Posts can optionally show the source conversation for transparency
- The platform supports traditional social features (reactions, comments, follows)

## Current Development Status - COMPLETED ✅

### 📋 **Database Schema Implementation Status**

Based on `mvp_db_schema.md`, here's what's implemented vs. remaining:

#### **✅ COMPLETED Tables**:
- `users` - User accounts and authentication
- `conversations` - AI conversation containers  
- `messages` - Individual messages in conversations
- `posts` - Blog posts created from conversations
- `comments` - Threaded comments with parent-child relationships
- `post_reactions` - 5-type reaction system for posts (upvote, downvote, heart, insightful, accurate)
- `comment_reactions` - Same 5-type reaction system for comments

#### **🚧 TODO Tables** (Next Phase):
- `tags` - Content tagging system
- `follows` - User following relationships
- `post_tags` - Many-to-many post tagging
- `post_views` - View tracking
- `post_shares` - Share tracking

## Next Development Phase Options

### **Option A: Repository Layer** (Recommended Next Step)
Implement data access patterns and business logic layer:
- Create repository classes for each model
- Implement common CRUD operations
- Add business logic and complex queries
- Establish service layer patterns

### **Option B: API Layer**
Build FastAPI endpoints for the models:
- REST API endpoints for User, Conversation, Message, Post
- Authentication and authorization
- Request/response schemas with Pydantic
- API versioning and documentation

### **Option C: Association Models**
Complete the remaining database models:
- User follows and social features
- Content tagging and categorization system
- Analytics and tracking tables (views, shares)

### **Option D: Frontend Integration** (New Option)
Start building the user interface:
- React/Next.js frontend setup
- API integration for existing models
- UI components for conversations, posts, reactions
- Real-time features with WebSockets

## Development Guidelines - CRITICAL TO FOLLOW

### **🧪 TDD Methodology (MANDATORY)**
This project follows strict Test-Driven Development:

1. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests first
2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimum code to pass tests  
3. **Refactor Phase**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **Iterate**: Small, incremental changes with full test coverage

### **📋 Development Process**:
1. **Examine existing code** thoroughly before making changes
2. **Write comprehensive tests** before implementing features
3. **Run tests frequently** to ensure no regressions
4. **Make small iterative changes** rather than large modifications
5. **Validate with both unit and integration tests**
6. **Follow established patterns** from existing models

### **🔧 Testing Commands**:
```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate ai-social

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/models/ -v

# Run specific model tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/models/test_user.py -v

# Run reaction system tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/models/test_post_reaction.py tests/unit/models/test_comment_reaction.py -v

# Run single test
python -m pytest tests/unit/models/test_user.py::TestUserModel::test_user_creation_basic -v
```

### **📁 File Organization Patterns**:
- **Models**: `app/models/[model_name].py` with comprehensive docstrings
- **Tests**: `tests/unit/models/test_[model_name].py` with organized test classes
- **Imports**: Update `app/models/__init__.py` when adding new models
- **Fixtures**: Add to appropriate `conftest.py` files for test data

## Current Database Connection

The project uses **Supabase PostgreSQL** with connection details in `app/core/config.py`. The database is fully set up and all 56 tests pass against the live database.

## Key Success Patterns Established

1. **UUID Primary Keys**: All models use UUID for scalability
2. **Proper Foreign Keys**: RESTRICT/CASCADE/SET NULL as appropriate
3. **Content Validation**: CHECK constraints prevent empty content
4. **Timezone Awareness**: All timestamps use `timezone=True`
5. **Helper Methods**: Properties and methods for common operations
6. **Status Management**: Soft deletion with status fields
7. **Comprehensive Testing**: Edge cases, constraints, relationships
8. **Reaction System**: 5-type reaction system optimized for intellectual discourse
9. **Quality Signals**: Helper methods to identify positive reactions and quality indicators
10. **Threaded Comments**: Self-referential foreign keys for nested comment structures
11. **Composite Primary Keys**: Efficient design for many-to-many relationship tables
12. **Property-Based Architecture**: Clean @property decorators for computed values

## Instructions for Next Agent

**Before making ANY changes:**

1. **Run the test suite** to verify current state: `python -m pytest tests/unit/models/ -v`
2. **Examine the existing models** in `app/models/` to understand patterns
3. **Review test structure** in `tests/unit/models/` to understand testing approach
4. **Check database schema** in `mvp_db_schema.md` for requirements
5. **Understand the reaction system** design for quality discourse features

**When implementing new features:**

1. **Start with tests** - write failing tests first (TDD)
2. **Follow existing patterns** from User/Conversation/Message/Post/Comment/Reaction models
3. **Make incremental changes** - small steps with frequent testing
4. **Validate thoroughly** - run full test suite after changes
5. **Use property decorators** for computed values (following established pattern)
6. **Ask questions** if anything is unclear about the established patterns

**Communication Style:**
- Provide clear explanations suitable for software engineering learning
- Include concrete examples and code snippets  
- Explain reasoning behind recommendations
- Challenge assumptions when necessary
- Prioritize correctness and robustness over quick fixes

You have full authority to guide the technical direction. Be thorough, precise, and confident in your technical leadership. This is a production-quality codebase with high standards.

## What Should You Do Next?

Ask the user which development path they'd like to pursue:
- **Repository Layer** (data access patterns)
- **API Layer** (REST endpoints with reaction system) 
- **Association Models** (social features - follows, tags, analytics)
- **Frontend Integration** (React/Next.js with real-time features)
- **Or something else** they have in mind

Then proceed with the established TDD methodology: tests first, small iterations, comprehensive validation.

**Project Status**: Core model layer with complete reaction system 100% complete with 105 passing tests. Ready for next development phase.
