## **Portfolio Framing: "AI-Powered Social Platform"**

### **The Technical Story:**
*"I built a social platform that bridges AI conversations and community discovery. Users engage in natural conversations with AI, then transform insights into discoverable social content. The technical challenges spanned three domains:"*

### **1. Real-Time AI Systems**
- *WebSocket streaming with connection management*
- *Conversation context handling across 50+ message threads*
- *Smart truncation and summarization for token limits*
- *Error handling for AI service failures*

### **2. Social Platform Engineering**
- *Feed generation algorithms balancing recency and relevance*
- *User discovery through conversation topic analysis*
- *Content transformation pipeline from chat to social posts*
- *Scalable data models for conversations + social graph*

### **3. Full-Stack Performance**
- *Sub-200ms API responses with proper caching*
- *Efficient conversation storage and retrieval*
- *Real-time UI updates without blocking*
- *Database optimization for social queries*

## **Key Technical Talking Points**

### **For SWE Interviews:**
1. **"How did you handle WebSocket connection management?"**
   - Connection pooling, graceful reconnection, message ordering

2. **"Walk me through your conversation context strategy"**
   - Sliding window approach, semantic importance scoring, context preservation

3. **"How does your feed ranking algorithm work?"**
   - Weighted scoring, A/B testing infrastructure, performance optimization

### **For AI Engineer Interviews:**
1. **"How do you maintain conversation quality over long sessions?"**
   - Context management, prompt engineering, quality scoring

2. **"Explain your summarization approach"**
   - Custom prompts, context preservation, iterative refinement

3. **"How do you handle semantic search at scale?"**
   - Vector embeddings, similarity scoring, search result ranking

## **Success Metrics to Track**

### **Technical Performance:**
- API response times (<200ms p95)
- WebSocket connection stability (>99% uptime)
- Search accuracy and speed
- Database query performance

### **User Engagement:**
- Conversation depth (avg messages per session)
- Summary creation rate (conversations → posts)
- Content discovery (feed engagement)
- User retention over 2 weeks

## **The Portfolio Pitch:**

*"This project demonstrates my ability to build complex, real-time systems that combine AI capabilities with social platform engineering. I focused on technical excellence: building bulletproof WebSocket streaming, intelligent conversation management, and scalable social architecture. The result is a production-ready platform that real users engage with daily."*

## **Technical Decisions Made**

### **AI & Context Management:**
- **Approach**: Sliding window with intelligent summarization
- **Why**: Maintains conversation quality while managing token limits
- **Alternative Considered**: RAG system (rejected as over-engineering)

### **Feed Ranking:**
- **Approach**: Simple weighted scoring (recency + following + engagement)
- **Why**: Fast, debuggable, easily improvable with real user data
- **Alternative Considered**: ML-based personalization (deferred to post-MVP)

### **Real-time Architecture:**
- **Approach**: WebSocket for AI streaming, REST for everything else
- **Why**: Optimal performance for each use case
- **Alternative Considered**: Server-sent events (less bidirectional control)

### **Search Implementation:**
- **Approach**: Vector embeddings with PostgreSQL pgvector
- **Why**: Semantic search capability with simple deployment
- **Alternative Considered**: Elasticsearch (overkill), Pinecone (external dependency)
