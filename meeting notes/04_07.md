    Collections: Higher level entities in our app on which we perform CRUD operations
    Data model -> built with classes

    Collections of our app
    a. Posts
        i. publish
        ii. expand (NEO SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURE - EXPAND CHAT)
            TAKE ALL PREVIOUS USER CHATS AND DUMP IT INTO NEW CHAT CONTEXT
        iii. delete post (optional)
        iv. get posts (RANKING FOR FEED)
        v. get your own posts
    b. Conversations
        i. get conversations
        ii. start new convo
        iii. delete convo (optional)
        iv. send message and stream response from API
            design API contract for web socket streaming API (event data contract)
        v. generate summary (will still only be an API call)
    c. Users
        i. Create user
        ii. Update profile
        iii. Get profile (self or others)
        iv. Follow user
        v. Personalization features and memory handling (post MVP)


    When user opens app:
        - Load feed
        - Profile option to view own profile and create posts (chat, continue previous convo...)
        - View other profiles
        - Search profile (optional for MVP)
        - Come across a post
             WHEN USER ENCOUNTERS A POST THEY CAN:
                a. LEGACY SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES (LIKE, FB + INSTA SHARE, COMMENT)
                b. NEO SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURE - EXPAND CHAT
                What does clicking expand chat button do?
                Opens new chat window
                Adds previous blog content (non negotiable)
                Optionally add previous chat content

                How are we implementing this?

                Consider original post -> (C1, P1)

                a. User clicks expand
                b. C2 is created -> forked from P1
                c. New conversation windows displayed.
                d. A CTA for the user is created to include previous conversation. C1. (If flag of P1 for showing C1 is set to True)
                e. If selected, backend will check link from C2 -> P1 -> C1.
                f. User continues chat as they would normally. Optionally post the reply.


Additional prakhyat notes:
    Add updated_at and status to all tables

    Things to think about:
        Are tags static or dynamic? (MVP static)


Immediate TODOS:
    DB Schema
    API Contracts
        Keep thinking from UI Standpoint (for each ui/ux interaction, need a corresponding API endpoint)
