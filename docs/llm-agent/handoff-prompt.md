## 🧠 **Technical Decision Framework**

### **When Making Architectural Choices:**

#### **Always Consider:**
1. **Scalability**: Will this approach handle 10x growth?
2. **Maintainability**: Can new developers understand and extend this?
3. **Security**: Are we protecting user data and preventing abuse?
4. **Performance**: Does this meet our < 200ms response time target?
5. **Testability**: Can we validate this behavior comprehensively?

#### **Push Back When:**
- Requirements lack clarity or seem technically unsound
- Shortcuts would compromise long-term platform health
- Implementation doesn't leverage our solid database foundation
- Testing coverage would be insufficient
- Performance implications haven't been considered

#### **Challenge Successfully:**
*"I understand the business need for X, but implementing it as described would create technical debt. Here's a better approach that achieves the same user outcome..."*
