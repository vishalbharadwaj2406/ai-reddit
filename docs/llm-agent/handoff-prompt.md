## 🧬 **Platform DNA: Conversation-Centric Architecture**

### **Unique Value Proposition:**
```
Users ←→ AI Conversations ←→ Published Posts ←→ Community Expansion
```

**Core Innovation**: Posts emerge from AI conversations, not standalone creation. Users can "expand" any post to start their own AI conversation thread.

### **Technical Philosophy:**
1. **Conversation-Centric**: All content flows from AI interactions
2. **Fork-Based Exploration**: Ideas branch and evolve through expansion
3. **Quality Over Quantity**: Reaction system promotes thoughtful engagement
4. **Privacy-First**: User control over conversation visibility and sharing

---

## 🛠️ **Development Methodology: Modern TDD Excellence**

### **Established Standards (Non-Negotiable):**

#### **Test-Driven Development**
```
Red → Green → Refactor → Integrate
```
- **Write tests first** for all new functionality
- **Small iterations** with frequent validation
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints with real database
- **Contract tests** ensuring API matches specification

#### **Quality Gates:**
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage on business logic
- [ ] Response times < 200ms for 95% of requests  
- [ ] Zero SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] All API endpoints match design specification
- [ ] Proper error handling and logging throughout

#### **Code Standards:**
- **Python**: PEP 8 with Black formatting, type hints required
- **Database**: Alembic migrations, proper indexing, soft deletion
- **API**: RESTful design, Pydantic validation, OpenAPI documentation

---

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **Phase 1: Core CRUD Endpoints (Days 1-4)**
1. **Enable Integration Tests**: Remove skips from 6 existing database integration tests
2. **Authentication Middleware**: Implement JWT token validation for protected endpoints
3. **User Management APIs**: Profile CRUD, follow/unfollow, privacy controls
4. **Basic Error Handling**: Consistent API error responses and validation

### **Phase 2: Content & Social APIs (Days 5-7)**
1. **Conversation APIs**: Create, read, message handling (without AI integration initially)
2. **Post Management**: Post CRUD, visibility controls, content editing  
3. **Social Features**: Reactions, comments, basic sharing functionality

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features & Polish (Days 8-10)**
1. **User Management**: Profile, follow/unfollow, privacy controls
2. **Conversation System**: WebSocket chat, AI integration, message handling
3. **Content Publishing**: Post creation, reactions, comments, sharing

### **Phase 3: Integration & Polish (Days 8-10)**
1. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user workflow validation
2. **Performance Optimization**: Query optimization, rate limiting
3. **Production Preparation**: Documentation, deployment, monitoring

## 🧠 **Technical Decision Framework**

### **When Making Architectural Choices:**

#### **Always Consider:**
1. **Scalability**: Will this approach handle 10x growth?
2. **Maintainability**: Can new developers understand and extend this?
3. **Security**: Are we protecting user data and preventing abuse?
4. **Performance**: Does this meet our < 200ms response time target?
5. **Testability**: Can we validate this behavior comprehensively?

#### **Push Back When:**
- Requirements lack clarity or seem technically unsound
- Shortcuts would compromise long-term platform health
- Implementation doesn't leverage our solid database foundation
- Testing coverage would be insufficient
- Performance implications haven't been considered

#### **Challenge Successfully:**
*"I understand the business need for X, but implementing it as described would create technical debt. Here's a better approach that achieves the same user outcome..."*
