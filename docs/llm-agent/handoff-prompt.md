# AI Social Backend Development - Sprint Handoff

## Current State Overview

**AI Social** is a conversation-centric social platform where users interact with AI to develop ideas, then publish posts for community engagement. The backend uses FastAPI + PostgreSQL with comprehensive TDD coverage.

### Today's Achievements (Complete Analytics & Tracking System)
- âœ… **Analytics & Tracking System**: Complete implementation via TDD
- âœ… **POST /posts/{post_id}/view**: Track post views (authenticated/anonymous)
- âœ… **POST /posts/{post_id}/share**: Track post shares with platform support
- âœ… **Enhanced Analytics**: GET /posts/{post_id} includes viewCount, shareCount, userViewCount
- âœ… **Service Layer**: `AnalyticsService` with transaction management and error handling
- âœ… **Test Coverage**: 12 comprehensive tests passing (view tracking, share tracking, integration)
- âœ… **Database Schema**: Post_Views and Post_Shares tables with proper indexing
- âœ… **POST Conversation Endpoint** implemented via TDD
- âœ… **GET /posts/{post_id}/conversation**: Full privacy controls and error handling
- âœ… **Comprehensive Backend Assessment**: Verified actual implementation status vs. specification

### Current Technical Status

- **Current Status**: 30 out of 30 core endpoints implemented (100% complete)
- **Impact**: Ready for production deployment and frontend integration

## Development Approach

### TDD Methodology (Established Pattern)
1. **Red**: Write failing tests first covering success/error/auth scenarios
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Clean up and optimize implementation
4. **Validate**: Ensure no regressions in existing functionality

### Code Quality Standards
- Type hints required for all functions
- Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Service layer pattern for business logic
- Repository pattern for data access
- Standardized API response format

## Technical Architecture

### Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL** via Supabase with Alembic migrations
- **13 Models**: User, Post, Comment, Reactions, Follow, Tags, Analytics
- **Soft deletion** pattern with status fields
- **UUID primary keys** for distributed architecture

### API Layer  
- **FastAPI** with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Pydantic schemas** for request/response validation
- **JWT authentication** with Google OAuth integration
- **RESTful design** with consistent error handling

### Service Architecture
```
API Endpoints â†’ Services (Business Logic) â†’ Repositories (Data Access) â†’ Database
```

## Next Sprint Priorities

### ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Focus (MVP Complete - Ready for Launch)
1. **Frontend Integration** - Connect Next.js frontend to complete backend APIs
   - All backend endpoints ready and tested
   - Real-time AI streaming integration
   - Social features UI completion
   - Production deployment preparation

### ðŸš€ Phase 2 Enhancements (Post-MVP)
1. **Advanced Conversation Features** - Enhanced forking workflows
   - `POST /conversations/{id}/include-original` - Include original conversation context in fork
   - `POST /conversations/{id}/uninclude-original` - Remove original conversation context from fork
   - Dynamic context management for enhanced user control

2. **Enhanced Discovery & Performance** - Scale and optimize
   - Content search capabilities with semantic search
   - Advanced user discovery and recommendation features  
   - Performance optimization for large-scale deployment
   - Advanced analytics and insights

## Communication Style

**You are a senior software engineer** taking over this codebase. Challenge requirements that seem unclear, suggest better technical approaches, and maintain high quality standards. The platform's success depends on technical excellence and user trust.

When making decisions:
- Prioritize long-term maintainability over quick fixes
- Consider scalability implications (this could serve millions of users)
- Ensure security best practices (users trust us with personal conversations)
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage

## Current Sprint Focus
