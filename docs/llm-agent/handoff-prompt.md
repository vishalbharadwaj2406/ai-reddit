# AI Social Backend Development - Sprint Handoff

## Current State Overview

**AI Social** is a conversation-centric social platform where users interact with AI to develop ideas, then publish posts for community engagement. The backend uses FastAPI + PostgreSQL with comprehensive TDD coverage.

### Today's Achievements (Post Reactions API MVP)
- ✅ **Complete Post Reactions API** implemented via TDD
- ✅ **Service Layer**: `PostReactionService` with toggle behavior (same reaction removes, different updates)
- ✅ **Repository Layer**: `PostReactionRepository` with CRUD operations  
- ✅ **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/posts/{post_id}/reaction` fully functional
- ✅ **Schema Validation**: `PostReactionCreate` with proper field validation (`reactionType`)
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: 3 comprehensive unit tests passing (success, validation, auth)
- ✅ **Reaction Types**: upvote, downvote, heart, insightful, accurate

### Current Technical Status
- **Database Models**: 13 tables complete with migrations applied
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth + JWT production-ready
- **API Endpoints**: User management, posts, comments, reactions all functional
- **Test Infrastructure**: 462/503 tests passing (92% success rate)
- **Environment**: AI Social conda environment with all dependencies configured

## Priority Issues to Address

### 1. Test Infrastructure (Critical)
**41 failing tests** need attention - primarily integration layer issues:
- Integration tests need fixture pattern updates
- Some tests missing database session parameters
- Authentication pattern inconsistencies in older tests

### 2. Missing Core Features
- **Tags System**: Tag creation and management endpoints
- **Search/Discovery**: Content filtering and search functionality  
- **Real-time Updates**: SSE streaming for live reactions/comments
- **Analytics**: View tracking and engagement metrics

### 3. Performance & Optimization
- Query optimization for feed algorithms
- Caching strategy for reaction counts
- Database indexing review

## Development Approach

### TDD Methodology (Established Pattern)
1. **Red**: Write failing tests first covering success/error/auth scenarios
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Clean up and optimize implementation
4. **Validate**: Ensure no regressions in existing functionality

### Code Quality Standards
- Type hints required for all functions
- Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Service layer pattern for business logic
- Repository pattern for data access
- Standardized API response format

## Technical Architecture

### Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL** via Supabase with Alembic migrations
- **13 Models**: User, Post, Comment, Reactions, Follow, Tags, Analytics
- **Soft deletion** pattern with status fields
- **UUID primary keys** for distributed architecture

### API Layer  
- **FastAPI** with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Pydantic schemas** for request/response validation
- **JWT authentication** with Google OAuth integration
- **RESTful design** with consistent error handling

### Service Architecture
```
API Endpoints → Services (Business Logic) → Repositories (Data Access) → Database
```

## Next Sprint Priorities

### Immediate
1. **Fix failing tests** - Update integration tests to current patterns
2. **Tags implementation** - Complete tag creation, assignment, and filtering
3. **Search endpoints** - Basic content discovery functionality

### Short-term
1. **Real-time features** - SSE streaming for live updates
2. **Analytics tracking** - View counts, engagement metrics
3. **Performance optimization** - Query optimization and caching


## Key Files & Locations

### Recent Implementation
- `app/services/post_reaction_service.py` - Business logic for reactions
- `app/repositories/post_reaction_repository.py` - Data access for reactions
- `app/api/v1/posts.py` - Post endpoints including new reaction endpoint
- `tests/unit/api/v1/test_post_reactions_api_unit.py` - TDD test suite

### Core Architecture
- `app/main.py` - FastAPI application setup and router registration
- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy models for all database tables
- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic schemas for API validation
- `alembic/versions/` - Database migration files

### Configuration
- `.env` - Environment variables (Google OAuth, DB credentials)
- `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies and project configuration
- `alembic.ini` - Database migration configuration

## Development Environment

### Setup Commands
```bash
conda activate ai-social
cd backend/
python -m pytest tests/unit/api/v1/test_post_reactions_api_unit.py -v  # Verify new functionality
python -m pytest --tb=short -x  # Run all tests, stop on first failure
```

### Database Access
- **Production**: Supabase PostgreSQL (configured via .env)
- **Test Environment**: Local PostgreSQL recommended for integration tests
- **Migrations**: `alembic upgrade head` to apply latest schema

## Success Metrics

### Technical Indicators
- Test coverage >95% for business logic
- All API endpoints respond <200ms for 95% of requests  
- Zero SQL injection vulnerabilities
- All failing tests resolved

### Feature Completion
- Complete CRUD operations for all content types
- Real-time updates working smoothly
- Search and discovery functional
- Analytics providing meaningful insights

## Communication Style

**You are a senior software engineer** taking over this codebase. Challenge requirements that seem unclear, suggest better technical approaches, and maintain high quality standards. The platform's success depends on technical excellence and user trust.

When making decisions:
- Prioritize long-term maintainability over quick fixes
- Consider scalability implications (this could serve millions of users)
- Ensure security best practices (users trust us with personal conversations)
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage

## Current Sprint Focus

**Primary Objective**: Fix failing tests and complete core content management features

**Secondary Objective**: Implement real-time capabilities and search functionality
