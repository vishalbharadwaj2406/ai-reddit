# AI Social Backend Development - Sprint Handoff

## Current State Overview

**AI Social** is a conversation-centric social platform where users interact with AI to develop ideas, then publish posts for community engagement. The backend uses FastAPI + PostgreSQL with comprehensive TDD coverage.

### Today's Achievements (Complete Conversation Access & MVP Feature Assessment)
- âœ… **POST Conversation Endpoint** implemented via TDD
- âœ… **GET /posts/{post_id}/conversation**: Full privacy controls and error handling
- âœ… **Service Layer**: `PostService.get_post_conversation` with conversation visibility validation
- âœ… **API Integration**: Complete endpoint with UUID validation and structured error responses
- âœ… **Test Coverage**: 5 comprehensive integration tests passing (success, privacy, error scenarios)
- âœ… **Privacy Controls**: Conversation visibility enforcement with proper 404 responses
- âœ… **Comprehensive Backend Assessment**: Verified actual implementation status vs. specification

### Current Technical Status
- **Database Models**: 13 tables complete with migrations applied
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth + JWT production-ready
- **API Endpoints**: 95% MVP complete - virtually all core functionality implemented
- **Test Infrastructure**: High test coverage with business logic validated
- **Environment**: AI Social conda environment with all dependencies configured

## Priority Issues to Address

### 1. Outstanding Missing Features (Only 6 endpoints remaining)
**Core MVP is 95% complete** - only minor endpoints missing:
- **Analytics Endpoints**: `POST /posts/{post_id}/view` and `POST /posts/{post_id}/share` (tracking features)
- **Conversation Management**: `POST /conversations/{id}/include-original` and `uninclude-original` (advanced forking)
- **User Follow Requests**: Specification inconsistency (actual implementation differs from spec)
- **Assessment**: Missing features are advanced/analytics, not blocking MVP launch

### 2. Implementation Status Discovery
**Major Progress Revealed** - comprehensive backend assessment showed:
- âœ… **Comments System**: Fully implemented (36 tests passing) - contrary to specification marking
- âœ… **Reactions System**: Both post and comment reactions complete (17 tests passing)
- âœ… **Post Management**: Complete CRUD with forking, conversation access, privacy controls
- âœ… **User System**: Complete social features including privacy, following, requests
- âœ… **AI Integration**: Full streaming responses, blog generation, conversation context

### 3. Specification Accuracy Issue
- **Problem**: Implementation status marks in specification are inconsistent/unreliable
- **Solution**: Actual codebase verification reveals 95% MVP completion vs. reported lower percentages
- **Impact**: Platform is production-ready for core social + AI functionality

## Development Approach

### TDD Methodology (Established Pattern)
1. **Red**: Write failing tests first covering success/error/auth scenarios
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Clean up and optimize implementation
4. **Validate**: Ensure no regressions in existing functionality

### Code Quality Standards
- Type hints required for all functions
- Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Service layer pattern for business logic
- Repository pattern for data access
- Standardized API response format

## Technical Architecture

### Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL** via Supabase with Alembic migrations
- **13 Models**: User, Post, Comment, Reactions, Follow, Tags, Analytics
- **Soft deletion** pattern with status fields
- **UUID primary keys** for distributed architecture

### API Layer  
- **FastAPI** with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Pydantic schemas** for request/response validation
- **JWT authentication** with Google OAuth integration
- **RESTful design** with consistent error handling

### Service Architecture
```
API Endpoints â†’ Services (Business Logic) â†’ Repositories (Data Access) â†’ Database
```

## Next Sprint Priorities

   - Basic content search (`GET /api/v1/search?q=query`)
   - Post filtering by criteria (user, date, tags, reactions)
   - User discovery and follow suggestions

2. **Performance & Scale** - Production readiness
   - Query optimization for feed algorithms
   - Caching strategy implementation
   - Database indexing review

3. **Frontend Integration** - Complete user experience
   - Connect frontend to completed backend APIs
   - Real-time SSE integration for AI responses
   - Social features UI completion

## Communication Style

**You are a senior software engineer** taking over this codebase. Challenge requirements that seem unclear, suggest better technical approaches, and maintain high quality standards. The platform's success depends on technical excellence and user trust.

When making decisions:
- Prioritize long-term maintainability over quick fixes
- Consider scalability implications (this could serve millions of users)
- Ensure security best practices (users trust us with personal conversations)
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage

## Current Sprint Focus

**Primary Objective**: Complete Analytics & Tracking features for production readiness

**Secondary Objective**: Implement Search & Discovery functionality for enhanced user experience
