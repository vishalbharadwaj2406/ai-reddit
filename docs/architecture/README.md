# Architecture Documentation

This section contains high-level system design, technical decisions, and architectural patterns for the AI Reddit platform.

## üìÅ Contents

### [Design Decisions](./design-decisions.md)
Comprehensive documentation of key architectural decisions, rationales, and design philosophy behind the AI Reddit MVP API design.

**Key Topics:**
- Core platform vision and differentiators
- Conversation-centric data model
- Elegant repost implementation via forking
- Custom blog flow design
- Real-time streaming decisions
- Authentication & security strategy
- Rate limiting and API patterns

### [API-Database Alignment](./api-db-alignment.md)
Analysis of how the API design aligns with the database schema, ensuring consistency and optimal implementation.

**Key Topics:**
- Perfect alignments between API and DB
- Implementation advantages
- Quality assessment (9.5/10 alignment score)
- Zero schema changes needed

## üéØ Architecture Principles

### 1. Conversation-Centric Design
- Posts emerge from AI conversations
- Maintains context and relationships
- Enables unique "expand post" functionality

### 2. Privacy-First Approach
- User privacy controls (public/private accounts)
- Conversation visibility settings
- Anonymous sharing support

### 3. Extensible Foundation
- UUID primary keys for distributed scaling
- Soft deletion via status fields
- JSON metadata fields for future extensions
- Modular API design for easy feature additions

### 4. Performance-Oriented
- Proper database indexing
- Efficient relationship queries
- Caching-ready architecture
- Rate limiting for resource protection
