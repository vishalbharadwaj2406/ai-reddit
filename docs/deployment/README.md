# Deployment Documentation

Production deployment, infrastructure, scaling, and operations documentation for the AI Social platform.

## Contents

*Documentation files will be added as deployment planning progresses.*

## Deployment Overview

### Current Status
- **Development**: Active (database layer + authentication complete)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) operational
- **Health Monitoring**: Database and system health endpoints active
- **Migration System**: Alembic configured and operational

- **Cache**: Redis for session management and caching (ready for implementation)
- **AI Services**: LangChain + Google Gemini API integration (production ready)
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0 services
- **Health Monitoring**: Database and system health endpoints
- **Migration System**: Alembic for database version control

### Frontend Services (Future)
- **Web Application**: React/Next.js application
- **CDN**: Static asset delivery and caching
- **Media Storage**: Image and file upload handling

### Supporting Infrastructure
- **Load Balancer**: High availability and traffic distribution
- **Monitoring**: Application and infrastructure monitoring
- **Logging**: Centralized log aggregation and analysis
- **Backup**: Database backup and disaster recovery

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: TLS/SSL for all communications
- **Database**: Encrypted at rest and in transit
- **API Security**: JWT tokens with proper expiration
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request sanitization

### Infrastructure Security
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to production systems
