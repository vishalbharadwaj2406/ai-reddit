### Day 6: Follower/Following Lists ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] GET /users/{user_id}/followers (followers list)
- [x] GET /users/{user_id}/following (following list)
- [x] Pagination support (limit/offset with has_next/has_previous)
- [x] Privacy-aware lists with comprehensive validation (12 tests passing)

## Track B: Content & Community APIs (Days 7-12)

### Day 7: Conversation Management ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] POST /conversations (create conversation)
- [x] GET /conversations (list user conversations with pagination)
- [x] GET /conversations/{id} (get conversation with messages)
- [x] DELETE /conversations/{id} (archive conversation via status field)
- [x] Conversation ownership validation and privacy controls
- [x] Comprehensive error handling (7 tests passing)

### Day 8: Post Management ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- [x] POST /posts (create from conversation) - 9 unit tests passing
- [x] GET /posts (public feed with hot ranking algorithm) - 15 E2E + 8 integration + 14 unit tests
- [x] Hot ranking algorithm implementation (time-decay formula)
- [x] Tag filtering and user filtering capabilities
- [x] Time-range filtering for top posts
- [x] 3-tier testing architecture (37 total tests across POST/GET endpoints)
- [ ] GET /posts/{id} (individual post retrieval) - endpoint defined, returns 501
- [ ] POST /posts/{id}/fork (conversation forking) - endpoint defined, returns 501

### Day 9: Social Features
- [ ] POST /posts/{id}/reaction
- [ ] GET /posts/{id}/comments
- [ ] POST /posts/{id}/comments
- [ ] POST /comments/{id}/reaction
- [ ] Share tracking endpoints

## Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Days 8-10)

### Day 8: Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end user workflows
- [ ] Authentication flow testing
- [ ] Conversation-to-post workflow
- [ ] Social interaction testing

### Day 9: Performance & Security
- [ ] Rate limiting validation
- [ ] Security headers implementation
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Caching strategy implementation

### Day 10: Documentation & Deployment Prep
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation completion
- [ ] Environment configuration
- [ ] Database migration scripts
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Repository/Service Layer)
```python
# Focus on business logic
def test_create_post_from_conversation()
def test_user_follow_privacy_logic()
def test_reaction_update_logic()
```

### Integration Tests (API Endpoints)
```python
# Focus on workflows
def test_complete_posting_workflow()
def test_authentication_flow()
def test_conversation_forking()
```

### Contract Tests (API Compliance)
```python
# Ensure API matches design spec
def test_response_format_compliance()
def test_error_code_consistency()
def test_pagination_standards()
```

## Quality Gates

### Track A: User & Social APIs ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] All API endpoints match design specification
- [x] 40/40 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- [x] Instagram-like privacy controls implemented
- [x] Response times consistently under 200ms
- [x] Zero security vulnerabilities in authentication and data access
- [x] Proper error handling with specific error codes
- [x] Pagination functional with has_next/has_previous indicators

### Track B: Content & Community APIs (In Progress)
- [x] Core conversation management endpoints complete (7 tests)
- [x] POST /posts endpoint fully implemented (9 unit tests)
- [x] GET /posts feed with filtering/pagination (15 E2E + 8 integration + 14 unit tests)
- [x] Hot ranking algorithm working with time-decay
- [ ] Individual post retrieval (GET /posts/{id}) - needs implementation
- [ ] Conversation forking (POST /posts/{id}/fork) - needs implementation
- [ ] Comment system endpoints pending
- [ ] AI integration with LangChain + Gemini API pending
- [ ] SSE streaming for real-time updates pending
