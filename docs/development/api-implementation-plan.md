## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Repository/Service Layer)
```python
# Focus on business logic
def test_create_post_from_conversation()
def test_user_follow_privacy_logic()
def test_reaction_update_logic()
```

### Integration Tests (API Endpoints)
```python
# Focus on workflows
def test_complete_posting_workflow()
def test_authentication_flow()
def test_conversation_forking()
```

### Contract Tests (API Compliance)
```python
# Ensure API matches design spec
def test_response_format_compliance()
def test_error_code_consistency()
def test_pagination_standards()
```
