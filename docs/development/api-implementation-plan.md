# AI Reddit API Implementation Plan

> **Latest Update (July 23, 2025)**: Track A (User & Social) complete! Track B Post Management complete including conversation forking. All MVP post endpoints operational with 48 tests passing. Social features remain for implementation.

## Frontend Development Status ‚úÖ MOSTLY COMPLETE - 1 KNOWN ISSUE

### UI Components & Design System ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Next.js 15 application with App Router
- [x] Royal Ink Glass design system with glass morphism effects
- [x] Tailwind CSS 4 integration
- [x] TypeScript configuration

- [x] Conversations page with search and filter functionality
- [x] Responsive design for all devices
- [x] Testing setup with Vitest

### Known Issues üîç NEEDS INVESTIGATION
- [ ] **Glass Effect Bug**: Header backdrop-filter blur works perfectly, but dropdown menu with identical CSS classes (`.header-glass`) appears transparent despite same styling. Investigation attempted:
  - Z-index stacking context adjusted (dropdown: z-index 101, header: z-index 100)
  - Transform animations removed from dropdown to prevent backdrop-filter interference
  - Global CSS import verified (.header-glass class properly loaded)
  - All conflicting styled-jsx CSS removed
  - **Root Cause**: Unknown - identical CSS produces different visual results
  - **Impact**: Dropdown menu lacks glass blur effect while header works perfectly
  - **Priority**: Medium - functional but visual inconsistency affects design system
